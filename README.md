### Overview

This Readme page provides a quick summary of how to build and run the IBM Bluemix SDK that will reside in VxWorks 7 on your device. The IBM Bluemix SDK is an embedded C client library for interacting with the IBM Watson Internet of Things (IoT) Platform. This client library is not provided in VxWorks 7 RPM packages or on the VxWorks 7 product DVDs . You will need to manually install this library on VxWorks 7.

### Installation

Before using this SDK with VxWorks 7, first download the SDK source code from the maintainer website:

    https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iotf-embeddedc.git

You will then need to apply a patch with some small changes that make the IBM Bluemix SDK compatible for VxWorks 7. Some unnecessary files will need to be removed from the SDK directory. These steps are executed by running the script setup.sh found in the directory bluemix/src.   
Place the bluemix layer in:

    $WIND_BASE/pkgs/net/cloud/bluemix

Then run the setup script:

    cd $WIND_BASE/pkgs/net/cloud/bluemix/src 
    ./setup.sh 

### VSB and VIP creation

VSB and VIP could be created in workbench UI environment as well as command line with vxprj tool. Here just list how to create them using vxprj tool, and take itl_quark BSP as an example. 

* VSB create

        vxprj vsb create -force -bsp itl_quark vsb_PENTIUM_32_up -S      
        cd vsb_PENTIUM_32_up      
        vxprj vsb add IBM_BLUEMIX     
        make -j     

* VIP create

        vxprj create -force -vsb vsb_PENTIUM_32_up itl_quark gnu vip_quark_kernel -profile PROFILE_STANDALONE_DEVELOPMENT  
        cd vip_quark_kernel  
        vxprj component add DRV_VXBEND_QRK_GMAC  
        vxprj component add INCLUDE_SHELL INCLUDE_NETWORK INCLUDE_IFCONFIG INCLUDE_PING  
        vxprj component add INCLUDE_IBM_BLUEMIX  
        vxprj parameter set DNSC_PRIMARY_NAME_SERVER "\"128.224.160.11\""  
        vxprj parameter set DNSC_SECONDARY_NAME_SERVER "\"147.11.57.128\""  

    The test sample of iotfclient is provided in cfg/usrBluemixDemo.c and in src/bluemixSample.c. It can be used to connect your device to the IBM Bluemix cloud, to publish events to the cloud, and to subscribe to commands from the IBM Bluemix cloud. To enable this sample, you need to add the INCLUDE_BLUEMIX_DEMO component, as shown below: 

        vxprj component add INCLUDE_BLUEMIX_DEMO

    If you want to create a connection to the quickstart service, set parameters as follows:

        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_QUICKSTART_MODE TRUE

    If you want to create a connection to a registered service, set parameters as follows:  

        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_QUICKSTART_MODE FALSE  
        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_DEVICE_ID "\"galileo_bb2b\""  
        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_DEVICE_TYPE "\"vx7_Galileo\""  
        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_ORG_ID "\"8hvetd\""  
        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_TOKEN "\"dhVLQ1U7@yqAffPME7\""  


    NOTE: The values of the above four parameters should be consistent with the information of the device registered in the IBM Watson IoT platform.  

    To set up a secure connection over SSL, first include the OPENSSL layer in the VSB, as follows:  

        vxprj vsb add OPENSSL  

    Then you can set BLUEMIX_SECURE_CONNECTION to either TRUE or FALSE in the VIP, depending on whether a secure connection is required. The default value is TRUE.  

        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_SECURE_CONNECTION TRUE  
        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_CAFILE_PATH "/romfs/SSLCACert.pem"   
        mkdir romfs   
        cp bluemix/certs/SSLCACert.pem ${VIP_DIR}/romfs   

    or  
    
        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_SECURE_CONNECTION   FALSE  

    The Bluemix sample can also be run in VxWorks user space (i.e., in a VxWorks RTP). A Bluemix RTP file bluemix.vxe is generated in ${VSB_DIR}/usr/root/gnu/bin when building the VSB. To auto-spawn the demo in an RTP, you need to add the INCLUDE_ROMFS component, then set parameter BLUEMIX_RTP_APP to TRUE, and set BLUEMIX_RTP_PATH to "/romfs/bluemix.vxe", as shown below:  

        vxprj component add INCLUDE_ROMFS  
        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_RTP_APP TRUE  
        vxprj parameter set BLUEMIX_RTP_PATH "/romfs/bluemix.vxe"  
        mkdir romfs  
        cp ${VSB_DIR}/usr/root/gnu/bin/bluemix.vxe romfs  
        vxprj build  

    Now you can bring up your device, and it will auto-run the Bluemix SDK in a VxWorks RTP. 

### Run image and view the visualization

You can run your device image with the Bluemix SDK and view the device dashboard at the IBM Bluemix website. 

* For the quickstart connection  
    View connection status here:  

    'https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/device/'

    Note: The device MAC address needs to be entered on this page, and it must be in lower case. 

* For the registered connection  
    View the device connection status here:  

    'https://${ORG_ID}.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/dashboard/#/devices/browse'  

    Replace ${ORG_ID} with your organizationâ€™s ID that is registered in IBM Bluemix. For example:

    'https://8hvetd.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/dashboard/#/devices/browse'  

* View application dashboard  
    You can also create the Node-RED application in the IBM Bluemix platform and view Bluemix cloud application dashboard here:  

    'https://console.ng.bluemix.net/?direct=classic/#/resources'
